\description{
The SEC generates a html page as an index for every filing it receives containing
all the metainformation about the filing. We extract 3 main types of information: 
\describe{
 \item{Filing Information}{Filing date, accepted date, etc.}
 \item{Documents}{All the documents included in the filing}
 \item{Filers}{Companies included in the filing}
 \item{Funds}{Funds included in the filing}
}
}
\details{
For a company, there is typically a single filer and no funds, but many filings
for funds get more complicated - e.g. 400+ funds with 100's of companies

NOTE: This can get process intensive for large fund pages. If you don't need all
components, try just usning filing_info
