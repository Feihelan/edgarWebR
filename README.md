## Introduction
edgarWebR provides an interface to access the [SEC's EDGAR
system](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm) for company
financial filings.

EdgarWebR does *not* provide any functionality to extract financial data or
other information from filings, only the metadata and company information. For
processing of the financia data.

## EDGAR Tools

The EDGAR System provides a number of [tools](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm)
for filing and entity lookup and examination. edgarWebR will eventually support
all of the provided tools, but for now it is focused on covering company and
fund search and resultant filings.

Once a filing is found via any of the above, there are a number of functions to
process the result - 
 * `filing_details`
 * `filing_documents`
 * `filing_filers`
 * `filing_funds`
 * `filing_information`
